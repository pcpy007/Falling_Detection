In this project, we use gyro in our mobile phone to get the data we need, and research the algorithm of detecting the elderly fallling.
Data are included accelerometer in tri-axis. We will simulate the falling process and get data to try to study our algorithm.
About algorithm, we plan to use the way of threshold value, and we wil use the SVM or DT to train our data and build a model.
